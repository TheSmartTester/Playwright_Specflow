# Playwright_Specflow

This starter Framework uses Specflow and Playwright .NET to conduct some API automation testing. All assertions are done using Fluent Assertions.

All of the development is within Visual Studio 2022 Community addition.

So the following list of items are used to achieve the testing.

- Specflow is used for housing the tests using the Gherkin syntax.
- Playwright is used for making the API calls.
- Fluent Assertions is for the verification.


The tests exercise the Rich and Morty API. (Full documentation can be found here) https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/
